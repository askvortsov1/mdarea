# The tiniest Markdown editor for the web

This project provides the simplest imaginable writing aid
for Markdown-enabled `<textarea>` elements.

It only supports a handful of features, mostly to save you keystrokes.
There's no GUI, no WYSIWYG features, and no preview.

It is also quite small at 1.33 KB gzipped.

# Installation

```bash
npm install mdarea
```

Or you can download the raw archive.
